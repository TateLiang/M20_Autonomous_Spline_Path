### Robot path planning using a hermite spline fit

M20 Math IA source code

> "To be able move around the field autonomously, the usual approach involves driving through discreet points in straight lines and turning in place. While this method is simple, there is non-negligible time taken stopping and starting between points. A more advanced method is to designate a continuous trajectory for the robot to follow, which is a smooth curve connecting two points in a plane with a particular velocity and acceleration at any given point. This ensures the robot does not stop and thus reduces the robotâ€™s travel time."
